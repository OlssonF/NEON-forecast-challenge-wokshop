# NEON-forecast-challenge-workshop materials
This is a repository for materials to complete the NEON Ecological Forecasting Challenge workshop using data and sites from the terrestrial daily theme.

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
The following packages will need to be installed
install.packages('remotes')
install.packages('tidyverse') # collection of R packages for data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation
install.packages('lubridate') # working with dates and times
remotes::install_github('eco4cast/neon4cast') # package from NEON4cast challenge organisers to assist with forecast building and submission
```
R version 4.2 is required to run the neon4cast package. It's also worth checking your Rtools is up to date. 

For the workshop you can follow along via the rmarkdown document (NEON_forecast_challenge_workshop.Rmd) or the md (NEON_forecast_challenge_workshop.md), both of which can be downloaded here or you can fork the whole repository.
